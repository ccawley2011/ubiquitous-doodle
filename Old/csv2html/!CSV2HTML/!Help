CSV2HTML v0.6
~~~~~~~~
CSV2HTML will take a CSV file and convert it to an HTML file

Syntax:

*csv2html <CSV file> [<HTML file>]

If no HTML file is specified, it will create a file called HTMLOutput in the current directory.
An example CSV file is included in the archive

v0.2 now supports cells with multiple lines and outputs in a more human readable format.

v0.3 supports blank lines in CSV files

v0.4 supports TSV files (CSV files separated with tabs instead of commas) and SID files (CSV files terminated using CR-LF)

v0.5 will use the Brandy BASIC interpreter if it can find it. This will allow CSV2HTML to cope with huge files. Brandy is available from http://jaguar.orpheusweb.co.uk/branpage.html

v0.6 makes several minor changes.
