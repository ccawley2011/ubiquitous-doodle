AddExt v0.2
~~~~~~
AddExt will add a DOS extension to a file by using the MimeMap module. Syntax:

*AddExt <filename>

Also included is a program called DOSType, which will set the filetype of a file by looking at the DOS extension at the end of the file (if it's there) and using the MimeMap modue. Syntax:

*DOSType <filename>

v0.2 will attempt to automatically set the file type of &FE4 (DOS) files when they're double-clicked.
